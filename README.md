# Time-Series-Forecasting
The code performs time series analysis on gold prices from 1950. It resamples the data to compute quarterly and decade averages, calculates yearly Coefficient of Variation (CV), and visualizes trends. It also applies a Naive forecast and Exponential Smoothing model to evaluate performance using MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error).
